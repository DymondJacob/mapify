Mapify has NO syntax errors :)

# It Does correctly throw errors when no/wrong information is put into form fields so make sure you enter in the form fields correctly, and do not leave them blank


#Installation Process 
- npm install (Install dependencies)
- npm start (Start the Application).

#Note (only follow if your os won't install packages)

App does run successfully on local machine but if need be you may have to install dependencies seperately (most likely will not have to but just incase.)
(Treehouse member successfully ran the project locally, but did have to install dependencies seperate on his os, so this is why I am adding this here as a note)
(May have to install dependencies seperately if need be)
 if so do the following
-npm init (fresh new cleared package.json file)
-npm install
-npm start
(It will then run successfully on local host if you did this method of installation)

#Port
(It runs locally on my port 5000)

#All requirements are met for capstone project with some exceeds

#Enjoy :)
